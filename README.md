# WatchListApp

This is a WinForms app I made using the .NET framework. It retains information on TV shows that I have watched and am currently watching. The data is retained on a
local SQL Server database. The shows are categorized into 4 separate categories: 'Watching', 'Curious', 'Waiting', and 'Finished'. This helps with organizing the 
status of each show. It's a fairly simple app that serves great purpose (for me, personally), and it helped me get familiar with C#, .NET, and MS SQL Server. For 
more information on this app, feel free to browse the code and my website, or contact me!
